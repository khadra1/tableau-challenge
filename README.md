# tableau-challenge: Visualising Citi Bike Data with Tableau
### Data source https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data


For this challenge I created mini dashboards to analayse one phenomenon or compare 2 phenemona in one dashboard with different views. I decided to split my story in 2:  One covering how Covid 19 Pandemic affected citi bike usage and one on Gender Distribution.

# Story 1:


- What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months? 
- What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
 
 Peak hours stay the same 8 am and 6pm) with obviously more bike trip to and from work during rush hours in the Spring to Autumn months and fewest in the Winter months.

- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? 
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? 

The Top 10 stations for starting and ending a journey are roughly the same with a few changing places. These are probably the stations closest to home and work places as most journeys seem to happen during rush hour times, start and end of work days.

- Did the Pandemic affect Length and Duration of Trips?

There is an obvious decrease on both Trip Lengths and Trip Durations in March and April 2020 at the start of the pandemic, especially when compared to the same time period in the previous year. By May there is an increase on both Length and Duration of Trips with especially the duration increasing significantly over the Summer and Autumn, above previous year levels. This is likely due to people wanting to avoid public transport for their commutes and trips.

- Map of the Start and End Stations sized by the total trips:

- Total Trips by Birth Year 

Those born in 1969 are the highest number of citi bike users by age. 1986 is in second place with almost 43,000 fewer riders!

# Story 2

### Gender Distribution citi bike usage data October 2018 - October 2020:

- Start and End Stations are the same across all Genders, with a couple changing spots on Start and End Station. Some Stations are more frequently used by Female riders or Unknown Gender (Gender has been removed from citi bike data after November 2020 but it could be useful in finding out what Stations are more popular with certain genders and why? Is it safety issues? I understand why they did it but they could have allowed for other gender options, to open up the options rather than rewmove it as demographic data is sometimes important in decision making).

- Total Rides by Gender. Did the Pandemic affect bike Usage by Gender? Do we see more Female or Unknown riders? 
We see more Customers than subscribers after the dip at the start of the pandemic. Possible new riders or previous Subscribers changing to Pay As You Go with the pandemic making future journeys for leisure and business more uncertain.

- Trip Length (miles) and Duration (mins) by Gender. Do they change in any meaningful way? 
As the number of rides rise towards the Summer months and after the first 3 months of Pandemic we see a sharp increase for most ride durataions and length. Peaking at levels higher than previous time period as people decide to travel by bike to avoid public transport . Trip durations start to dip again in October 2020 both the colder months. The new waves of Covid around colder months could account for that, but requires further investigation and more data to give an accurate analysis.
